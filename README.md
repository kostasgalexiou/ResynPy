# resynthesis

Resynthesis is a time-efficient pipeline written in python that interrogates the genotyping data of a segregating population of plants, aiming to the detection of individuals with complementary genotyping profiles.

## Prerequisites

Apart from python, all the other packages are optional for the user to install. These optional packages are required for graphical representation of data generated by the pipeline.

- python (version 3.8.10 or higher)
- pandas (version 0.25.3 or higher)
- matplotlib (version 3.1.2 or higher)
- seaborn (0.11.2)

**_Note for Windows users_**: instead of using the Command Prompt window, a user can also use the "Terminal" tab in the lower left area of the [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) environment.

1. **Python installation**
